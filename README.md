This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#Mil-MOA Calculator
This Web Application takes in user data about distance to target and wind and calculates Rifle Scope adjustments needed to hit the target.

#Installation
Clone the repo onto your local environment

Install dependencies
<code>npm install</code>

Run the calculator

Enjoy :)

#New releases
Currently working on adding the ability for users to add in their own accounts and add data based on the builds, wind, location, etc.
